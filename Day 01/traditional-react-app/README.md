NOTE:-

To make things easy, we delete some of the following files;
-> delete all files from "public" folder except index.html
-> delete all files from "src" except App.js & index.js

After this, in App.jsx & main.jsx there are very unecessary code that shown to you
we don't need it so remove all and copy the same code as given in these files

-> Most of the important files are App.jsx & main.jsx that we are working on..!
-> Other things remain same as it is... now things become easy.
