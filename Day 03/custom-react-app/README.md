NOTE:-

We discuss about these following things;

-> Understanding core react working by creating custom basic react
-> Defining own customRender function that takes an object and insert into DOM
-> Defining reactElement, an object of an element in the form;
{
type: tag,
props: {
attributes
},
children: innerText
}
