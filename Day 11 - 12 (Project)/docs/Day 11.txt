From, now we are working on a Mega Project and that is a "Blog Website" with full backend & database functionality (authentication, authorization, image uploading and many more).

Because this is a ReactJS project (main focus) so we use a service 'Backend-as-a-Service' named as 'Appwrite' that handle backend and store data in the database.

Some other packages and tools that are used;

-> TinyMCE (npm package) - A react component that provides a text editor with all styling functionality.

-> html-react-parser (npm package) - To parse the HTML that is stored directly in database to remember the post content styling (e.g., bold, italic)

-> React Hook Form

-> Environment Variables at Frontend-Side
