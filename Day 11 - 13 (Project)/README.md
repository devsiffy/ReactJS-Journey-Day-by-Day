### IMPORTANT NOTE:-

We are developing a Blogging website with full stack functionality using appwrite (backend as a service) to handle backend and database.

Our project main goals is to handle backend request-response cycle (APIs) professionally on the frontend side.

We develop this project in some days, and each day's progress (work) is documented in the "/docs" folder day-wise.

```
NOTE:- I don't share my '.env' credentials, instead of I share the 'must_change.env' file in which I define all the credentials that are used in the project so first you must change its name to '.env' and add your own credential values to the credential variables required in that file..!
```
