Today, I learned about these following topics;

-> What is state management
-> Short history of 'Flux' for state management and then how 'Redux' is introduced
-> what is redux, react redux, and redux-toolkit
-> What is store, reducers, slicers, useDispatcher, useSelector
-> What is Provider (use as wrapper on App) from react-redux
-> How to configureStore and createSlicer
-> What are the parameters (state and action) of the define method in reducers
-> What is nanoid and use of it for generating 'id' value
