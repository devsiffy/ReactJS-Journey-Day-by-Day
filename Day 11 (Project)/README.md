### IMPORTANT NOTE:-

We are developing a Blogging website with full stack functionality using appwrite (backend as a service) to handle backend and database.

Our project main goals is to handle backend request-response cycle (APIs) professionally on the frontend side.

We develop this project in some days, and each day's progress (work) is documented in the "/docs" folder day-wise.
